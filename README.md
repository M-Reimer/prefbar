# PrefBar Archive
Here you'll find the archived PrefBar project.
PrefBar was an "All In One" Add-on for Mozilla browsers which has been replaced by some
[Replacement Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/collections/manuel-reimer/prefbar/)

PrefBar started as a simple toolbar to get easy access to common preferences like Javascript, Flash, the proxy used for web access, ... Over the time, PrefBar got further developed to be a container for nearly everything, that can be placed on a button, checkbox or menulist.

PrefBar allowed stuff like "immediate installation without browser restart" or "customizable toolbar" long before Firefox had those built-in. With the ongoing Firefox development, the button management, provided by PrefBar, got more and more obsolete. Nowadays it is much easier to do the same with individual Add-ons for each task.
