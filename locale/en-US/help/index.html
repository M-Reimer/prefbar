        Welcome to the Preferences Toolbar documentation!  Unlike the original PrefBar--which included no documentation whatsoever--the PrefBar 4 comes with the huge wonderful complete help file you are currently viewing.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are currently using PrefBar v. 6.0.0rc2, build date 20110703. (If you are viewing this documentation online that doesn't necessarily apply to you.)

        Please select the section you would like from the menu above, or read on for a description of each page.
