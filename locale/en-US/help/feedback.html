        I've tried my best to make sure that almost everyone should find everything they need to know about the prefbar right here in this help system.  However, if you have read all this and still need help, you've come to the right place.  Read on for more info.

      <p>
        If you have a question, be sure to check <a href="faq.html">the FAQ</a> before sending me email to make sure your question isn't listed there.  Right now there actually aren't a whole lot of questions in the FAQ, but I hope to fill it up with real user questions as I get asked them after the first version of the PrefBar2 is released.

      <h2 id="bugzilla">Bugzilla</h2>

        All prefbar bugs are now managed through the bugzilla system on mozdev.org.  To file a new bug or view existing bugs, see <a href="http://bugzilla.mozdev.org">bugzilla.mozdev.org</a>.
